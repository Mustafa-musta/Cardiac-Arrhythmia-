# Cardiac-Arrhythmia-The Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a technique in cardiology for the analysis of cardiac condition of the patients. In its basic definition, ECG is the electrical representation of the contractile activity of the heart, and can be recorded fairly easily by using surface electrodes on the limbs or chest of the patient. The ECG is one of the most recognized and used biomedical signal in the field of medicine. The rhythm of the heart in terms of beats per minute (bpm) can be easily calculated by counting the R peaks of the ECG wave during one minute of recording. More importantly, rhythm and the morphology of the ECG waveform is altered by cardiovascular diseases and abnormalities such as the cardiac arrhythmias, which their automatic detection and classification is the main focus of this study.

The aim of this project is to distinguish between the presence and absence of cardiac arrhythmia.
